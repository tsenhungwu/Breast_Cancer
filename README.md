# Introduction
Human can make mistakes and baised judgements, and have subjective thinking when making important decisions. In the healthcare industry, doctors might be tired of inspecting images to diagnose whether a patient has breast cancer or not.

In this project, I aimed to provide solutions which could help doctors making firm decisions, automating the diagnosis process, and focusing more on the subsequent prescribtion and medical treatment processes.

# Objectives
- Classify a record based on its associated real-valued features which are computed for each cell nucleus into either a malignant or benign group using Machine Learning Classification algorithms.
- Build Machine Learning Classification algorithms which can automatically classify patients into groups.
- Optimize model performance through Bayesian Optimization hyperparameter tuning.
- Validate predictions by providing feature importance report.
