# Introduction
Human beings can make mistakes and biased judgments, and have subjective thinkings when making important decisions. In the healthcare industry, doctors might be tired of inspecting images to diagnose whether a patient has breast cancer or not, which might further lead to a wrong conclusion. Patients feel panic if they incorrectly diagnosed as having breast cancer, but they, in fact, don't have breast cancer. On the other hand, patients feel relieved but turn to anxious when they diagnosed as not having breast cancer initially and didn't receive treatment immediately.

In this project, I aimed to provide solutions which could help doctors making firm decisions, automating the diagnosis process, and focusing more on the subsequent prescription and medical treatment processes.

# Objective
- Classify a record based on its associated real-valued features which are computed for each cell nucleus into either a malignant or benign group using Machine Learning Classification algorithms.

# Main Tasks 
- Cleaned the original dataset by removing irrelevant features.
- Performed feature selection through Exploratory Data Analysis and Two-sample T-testing.
- Built Machine Learning Classification algorithms which can automatically classify patients into groups.
- Optimized model performance through Bayesian Optimization hyperparameter tuning.
- Validated predictions by providing feature importance report.
